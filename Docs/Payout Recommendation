Payout Recommendation


User Story

As an end user, the Payout plan must be recommended to me, considering the below factors:

Payout Mortgage first

Consider standing Instructions

Consider Minimum balance before paying off

Always payout from an account with least AER %

Always Payoff the Credit card which is charging Maximum APR %

This should result in maximizing savings and minimize the payout.

Two use cases need to be considered,

a. When the customer has enough money to service all his credits.

b. When the customer has not enough funds to service his credits.

Technical Tasks

a. Implementation of an API to make the payment from the Debit account to the Credit account.

b. The payout logic should be developed according the logic mentioned above.

c. Currently, no DB is unavailable. When available, reflect the changes in the DB.

d. Make the request from the Front end to update the outstanding balance in the UI.

e. Unit test the end point.

f. Use this end point for payout - http://localhost:3002/payOutPlanService
